<h1>Hello girls.</h1>
<p> It is one of the first nights of <strong>Code First: Girls</strong>. We are 30 girls who are coming together over the summer to learn to code.</p>
<h2> So who and what are we? </h2>
We are...
<ul>
	<li>Inspired by technological progress.
	<li>Informed about it by all means of communication, let it be TED talks, Techcrunch articles, or all the exciting tech companies and startups around us!
	<li> Absolutely committed to learn to code!
	</ul>
<h3>
	WEEK 1
</h3>
We have started off week 1 by getting familiar with html, a bit of CSS and most importantly with git, the repository that we will be using for the next 8 weeks (and who knows, maybe even longer than that).

<h3> WEEK 2
</h3>
